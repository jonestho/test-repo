Wheeeeeeeeen the moon hits your eye like a pizza pie, that's a moreeeeeeeeeee.

I don't know how to spell it.

Sometimes I forget how good pizza is.

In recent years, my favorite food changed to sushi; however, I still love pizza almost equally as much.

I wonder if you could diet off pizza?

Maybe. It'd have to have veggies n' stuff on it though.

Either way, thanks for reading all this, whoever-you-are.

See you later!
