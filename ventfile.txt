There's a lot of uncertainty right now.
I don't mind if someone sees this.

I've been having a rough time recently and apparently I thought-
-this was a good idea to incorporate this into my practice.

It's always good to practice when you're learning how to code--that's how you learn.

Code, code, and code.

I will also attempt to merge this into the "master" branch.

However, in the original branch, I'll add more to this.

Thank you.
