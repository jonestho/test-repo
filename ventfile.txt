There's a lot of uncertainty right now.
I don't mind if someone sees this.

I've been having a rough time recently and apparently I thought-
-this was a good idea to incorporate this into my practice.

It's always good to practice when you're learning how to code--that's how you learn.

Code, code, and code.

I will also attempt to merge this into the "master" branch.

However, in the original branch, I'll add more to this.

Thank you.

--CONTEXT--

I broke up with my girlfriend; however, I feel as if it was too soon for me to decide that.
I've also been nervous about this class and a few other things, but I'm more at ease since I'm giving myself-
-something to practice.

Hopefully in the next coming weeks, I'll be able to determine what's best for me--relationship-wise.
I wonder if this will cause a merge conflict?

Oops, I pushed before actually doing anything.
